# GreatSPN-BinaryBuild

A project to host binary artifacts for GreatSPN : a model-checker and analysis tool for Petri nets and their stochastic and symmetric (a.k.a. well-formed) extensions.
 
This project builds binaries for linux, Windows and OSX using public providers : [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/) and [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/).  These binary targets are provided for convenience, in the hope that they may prove useful.

The resulting binaries can be downloaded from this page : [Binary builds](https://lip6.github.io/GreatSPN-BinaryBuild/)
